the previous message contains the output of a text based program that is currently running. you are interacting directly with this text based program. I want you to emit the next command in order to make progress on the task you think you need to make progress on. if you need to hit the "enter" key, just emit <ENTER> as part of your response and I'll take both your text output and hit the enter key on your behalf. Just emit the next command, nothing else. try and avoid repeated commands over and over again.
