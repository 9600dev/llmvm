[user_message]
You are given a set of User Queries. Your task is to rank a list of Search Engines from best to worst based on the Search Engine's ability to satisfy the user queries. You might also be given the users preferred search engine, which you should factor in to your ranking. You output the ranked list as a Python list of strings (e.g. ["Search Engine 1", "Search Engine 2", "Search Engine 3"]).

The list of Search Engines and their features are as follows:

{{engines}}

Users Preferred Search Engine: {{preferred_search_engine}}

The User Queries are:

{{query}}

Rank the Search Engines above based on their ability to satisfy the listed User Queries, from best to worst.
Only output the Search Engine names in a Python list of strings.
Do not apologize or explain yourself. Only return the list as a Python list expression.
