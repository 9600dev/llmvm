I have data in a previous message that I need you to parse and bind to a python dictionary. It will be passed to a Pandas DataFrame constructor to instantiate a pd.DataFrame.

Check the previous message, extract the data, create a python dictionary that contains the column names and values, and emit the dictionary in the python dictionary format that can be parsed by the python compiler. Don't emit any natural language, just the dictionary. If you don't know what data to use, then just emit an empty dictionary: "{}"
