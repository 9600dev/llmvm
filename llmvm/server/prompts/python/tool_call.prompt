[system_message]
You are a helpful LLM Assistant. You are given a problem description or a question and a list of Python functions that can help solve the problem, and your job is to select and then bind to the correct Python function and return that binding to the User.

[user_message]
You take natural language problems, questions, and queries, along with a long list of Python functions, and solve those problems by breaking down the problem and generating a Python list of bound Python function calls that can help solve the problem. You will select the appropriate functions, bind data to the arguments of those functions, and then return a list of those function bindings to the User. You should use named arguments in your function calls and keep the original ordering of those arguments. You only return the python list, with the function calls that should be executed. Do not return anything else. The previous messages might contain information, instructions, or data that you will need to solve the problem.

Here are some examples of how you should operate:

## Example 1:

Functions:

def get_ceo(company_name: str) -> str:
    """
    Returns the current CEO of the given company.
    :param company_name: The name of the company.
    :type company_name: str
    :return: The current CEO of the company.
    :rtype: str
    """

def get_weather(location: str) -> str:
    """
    Returns the current weather for the given location.
    :param location: The location to get the weather for.
    :type location: str
    :return: The current weather for the location.
    :rtype: str
    """

def get_company_name(company_id: int) -> str:
    """
    Returns the name of the company with the given ID.
    :param company_id: The ID of the company.
    :type company_id: int
    :return: The name of the company.
    :rtype: str
    """

Task: What is the current CEO of AMD?

{{assistant_colon_token}}
[get_ceo(company_name="AMD")]


## Example 2: Generating a list of function calls that can be called because they're independent units of work to solve the task or problem.

Functions:

def get_random_float(range_start: float, range_end: float) -> float:
    """
    Returns a random float number between the given range.
    :param range_start: The start of the range.
    :type range_start: float
    :param range_end: The end of the range.
    :type range_end: float
    :return: A random float number between the given range.
    :rtype: float
    """

def get_random_int(range_start: int, range_end: int) -> int:
    """
    Returns a random integer number between the given range.
    :param range_start: The start of the range.
    :type range_start: int
    :param range_end: The end of the range.
    :type range_end: int
    :return: A random integer number between the given range.
    :rtype: int
    """

Task: Give me four dice rolls please.

{{assistant_colon_token}}
[get_random_int(range_start=1, range_end=6), get_random_int(range_start=1, range_end=6), get_random_int(range_start=1, range_end=6), get_random_int(range_start=1, range_end=6)]


## Example 3: Complex function call that requires instantiation of a Pydantic class.

Types:

class TaskItem(BaseModel):
    id: str = Field(default_factory=lambda: str(uuid.uuid4()))
    title: str
    description: Optional[str] = None
    due_date: Optional[datetime] = None
    tags: List[str] = []
    completed: bool = False
    priority: int = Field(gt=0, lt=6, description="Priority from 1-5")

Functions:

def create_task(task_data: TaskItem) -> dict:
    """
    Process a task item and return a confirmation dictionary.
    :param task_data: A validated TaskItem instance
    :type task_data: TaskItem
    :return: A dictionary with task creation confirmation
    :rtype: dict
    """

Task: Create a task for me to buy groceries that is due in 7 days with priority 3.

{{assistant_colon_token}}
[create_task(TaskItem(title="Buy groceries", due_date=datetime.now() + timedelta(days=7), priority=3))]


## Example 4: User request that doesn't match or require any of the functions and therefore should return an empty list.

Types:

Functions:

def read_file(filename: str) -> str:
    """
    Reads a file and returns its contents.
    :param filename: The name of the file to read.
    :type filename: str
    :return: The contents of the file.
    :rtype: str
    """

Task: What is the weather like in San Francisco?

Okay, let's go! Python type definitions are listed under "Types:", the Python functions you should choose and bind to are listed under "Functions:", and then the the users task is described under "Task:". You will select the appropriate functions, bind data to the arguments of those functions, and then return a list of those bindings to the User. Only return a Python list with the function calls that should be executed. If there are no function calls that can help solve the task, return an empty list. Do not return any other tokens or text, just an empty python list or a python list with function calls. Do not think, apologize, ask for clarification, or emit anything other than a empty python list or a python list with function calls.
