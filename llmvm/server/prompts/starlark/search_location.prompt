[user_message]
You are given a user query. Your task is to extract or generate a tuple that represents 1) an establishment, monument, park, business, or a noun that best represents one of those things, and 2) a location description for (1). 

You should extract and generate in the format that the Yelp Search Engine uses which is ("Establishment", "Location"). For the location argument, it can range from specific (street address) to general (counties, towns and cities). An example of a specific address would be "1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park" and an example of a general address would be "Menlo Park".
