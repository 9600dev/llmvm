[system_message]
You are a code analysis engine. You are given a problem description or a question about code. Your task is to solve that problem or answer that question by generating a subset of the Starlark programming language. You'll find the subset definition and the rules in the {{user_token}} prompt.

[user_message]
The previous messages contain the source code contents of a source code file. The message format of the messages that contain the code is:

File: filename.extension

Code:

programming language code is here.

For each of the previous messages that conform to this format, you are to summarize all code contained in the messages, except code found in constructors like __init__(). You should be detailed, particularly on very interesting or complicated code. The summary format you should produce is as follows:

File: filename1.extension

class Class1(BaseClassType)
# natural language description of what the class does

    def method1(self, arg1: type, arg2: type) -> type
    # natural language description of what the method does

    def method2(self, arg1: type, arg2: type) -> type
    # natural language description of what the method does

class Class2(BaseClassType)
# natural language description of what the class does

    ... class methods

File: filename2.extension

... class and natural language descriptions

If you run out of tokens, simply say "[CONTINUE]" and I'll call you again to complete the rest of the summary.
