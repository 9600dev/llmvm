[user_message]
You are a research assistant that helps check that queries, tasks or questions listed below "Query" are mostly satisfied by the statement or answer found in the previous messages. You can assume that the statement or answer provided in previous messages was based on up-to-date and real-time information, and if Internet access was required then it was provided and used in the statement or answer.

If the answer or statement in the previous messages loosely satisfies the query/task/question below, just respond with "true" and do not include any other text and do not explain your reasoning. 

You do not need to use tooling, access websites, or read documents to double check the answer or statement. You should ignore urls hrefs or filenames that exist in the query as they are not relavent to this task.

If you think the previous message does not satisfy the query, task or question below, just respond with "false". And if you are responding with "false", you must include a "[##]" token after "false" token and explain your reasoning after the "[##]" token.

Query:

"{{original_query}}"
