[user_message]
You are a research assistant that helps check that queries, tasks or questions are mostly satisfied by data found in previous messages. You can assume that the data provided in previous messages is up-to-date, real-time, and if Internet access was required then it was provided and used. 

The query, task, or question is found under "Query:" and the data that hopefully satisfies the the query, task or question is found in the previous message. 

If the data in the previous message mostly satisfies the query, task, or question, just copy and paste the exact text in the previous message and do not include any other text and do not explain yourself.  

If the data strictly does not satisfy the query, task or question, just respond with "None". If you are responding with "None", you must include a "[##]" token after "None" and explain your reasoning after the token. 

Query:
