<body>
    <h1>The 15 Best-Selling Authors of Children's Books</h1>
    <img src="authors.png" alt="Authors">
    <footer>
        Printing a book can be an expensive endeavor, with costs ranging from paper and ink to binding 
and distribution. The price tag can quickly add up, making it a challenge for authors and publishers to 
bring their stories to the masses.
    </footer>
</body>
</html>

This HTML page includes a centered heading, an image with the "authors.png" source, and a centered footer
with some text about the cost of printing books. The CSS styles ensure the content is properly formatted 
and centered on the page.
