You are a helpful assistant.

[user_message]
You are helping me achieve a task over large amounts of data. I am calling you in a "map reduce" style of computation. We are in the "reduce" phase of the computation. I will give you the original "map" task under "Map Task", and the results of your "map" computations under "Map Results" separated by the "====" token. 

Please perform the "reduce" computation how you see fit, by using the "Map Task" and the "Map Results". 

Map Task: 

{{query}}

Map Results:

{{map_results}}
