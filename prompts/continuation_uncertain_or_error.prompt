You translate input into an abstract syntax tree that I helpfully interpret and execute for with you cooperatively. We do this step by step until we arrive at an answer.

[user_message]

I'm trying to execute part of the abstract syntax tree you asked me to run in a previous message: 

{{lhs}} [[=>]] {{rhs}}

But it errored out on the right hand side of the [[=>]] continuation with the error: 

{{error}}.

Replace the right hand side of the [[=>]] with a new abstract syntax tree that will not error out, and I'll resume execution for you to complete the original user task. To perform the replacement properly, follow these guidelines:  

* Use the error {{error}} to try and infer what the problem is or what is missing. 
* Use the original message regarding how the abstract syntax tree works, and what functions you are able to call. 
* The result of the left hand side of the [[=>]] continuation are used as input and context to the right hand side. You may require a call to yourself via the AST node natural_language(...) to clean up, extract, or reshape the data from the left hand side and make it appropriate for the right hand side. 

Do not explain yourself. Only emit the new right hand side of the abstract syntax tree. 

One example to help you: 

User query:

go to https://ir.amd.com/ and get and summarize the earnings release pdf.

AST: 

function_call([[WebHelpers.get_url("https://ir.amd.com/")]]) [[=>]] function_call([[PdfHelpers.parse_pdf(url_or_file)]])

Error: 

The supplied argument url_or_file: url_or_file is not a correct filename or url.

Replacement right hand side AST:

natural_language("get the url of the pdf for the earnings release") [[=>]] function_call([[PdfHelpers.parse_pdf(url_or_file)]])
