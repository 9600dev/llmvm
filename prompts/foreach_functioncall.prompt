I have a list below under "List". I need to iterate over this list and call the helper function [[{{function_call}}]]. Take the list and generate function calls for each element in the list. Answer succinctly, do not explain yourself, or offer suggestions, just emit the helper function calls.

Function calls follow this pattern: 

[[Helpers.function_call_example('string argument', 2, 'another argument')]]
[[Helpers.function_call_two('string argument')]]

Use that pattern in your output. 

List:

{{list}}

You might need to use extra context from previous messages to fill in any arguments to the helper functions that might be missing from the list.
