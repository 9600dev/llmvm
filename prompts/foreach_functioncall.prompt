I have a list below under "List". I need to iterate over this list and call the helper function [[{{function_call}}]]. Take the list and generate function calls for each element in the list. Answer succinctly, do not explain yourself, or offer suggestions, just emit the function calls.

Follow this pattern for outputting function calls: 

[[Helpers.function_call_example("string argument", 2, "another argument")]]
[[Helpers.example_two("string argument")]]

List:

{{list}}

If the list doesn't contain sufficient information to populate the function call arguments, use previous messages I've sent you to try and extract the arguments. If you can't figure out the correct argument using the previous messages I've sent you, just use the string "missing" as the argument.
