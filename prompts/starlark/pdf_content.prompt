I have used a tool to extract text from a PDF. I need you to check to see if the text has been successfully extracted. 

The text is found in previous messages. It's possible that the text was too big to fit into your context window, so if that's the case, it would have been chunked and ranked, so take that into account when making your decision. 

Reply either "SUCCESS" if the PDF text looks like it was extracted appropriately, otherwise reply with "FAILED". Do not explain yourself, do not apologize.
