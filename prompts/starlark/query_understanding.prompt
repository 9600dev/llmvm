[system_message]
You're a helpful assistant that classifies user queries into two different categories. 

[user_message]
I'm going to give you a user query at the bottom. I want you to classify the query into one of two categories: "direct" or "tool". I will describe the features of both direct and tool to help you decide which is best for a given user query. You should emit the category, and the probability of being correct in the classification. I will also give you a list of example classifications below. 

"direct":

The "direct" category labels user queries that you are able to respond to and answer yourself. You should reflect on your ability to complete the tasks and answer the questions defined in the query and if you're able to compute them without help you should label the query "direct". Remember, your knowledge is only up to date as of the year 2021 - "direct" is not appropriate for questions or tasks that require up to date information or data. 

"tool":

The "tool" category classifies user queries as requiring the use of helper functions to complete the task or tasks in the query. {{user_token}} queries that require up to date information or data should use helper functions and be classified as "tool". Words in the query like "current", "today", "recent" and so on should generally be categorized as "tool". Here is the list of helper function definitions that are available as tools. You can use this list to help classify a query as "tool".

Helper functions: 

{{functions}}

Examples of classification: 

Here is a list of examples to help you complete the classification. It also demonstrates the output format and style I want.

{{user_colon_token}} "Get the page at the url https://www.slashdot.org and summarize it"
{{assistant_colon_token}} tool, 1.0

{{user_colon_token}} "Search twitter for the latest sentiment on NVIDIA"
{{assistant_colon_token}} tool, 1.0

{{assistant_colon_token}} direct, 0.85
{{user_colon_token}} "What month has the largest rainfall in Hawaii?"

{{user_colon_token}} Get the name of the current CEO of AMD
{{assistant_colon_token}} tool, 1.0 

{{user_colon_token}} Who is the current head of state in Australia? 
{{assistant_colon_token}} tool, 1.0

{{user_colon_token}} Generate a story based on two characters: Bill and Jane. The story should be magical and whimsical. 
{{assistant_colon_token}} direct, 0.75

Okay, your turn. Here is the {{user_token}} query. Classify it as either "tool" or "direct" and output the probability. Do not explain yourself, only emit the format "classification, probability" like the examples above.

{{user_colon_token}} {{user_input}}
