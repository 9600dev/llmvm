I have a high level goal of "{{goal}}". 

I have sent you a list in a previous message. I need you to help me late-bind that list to a python call-site. I have the python function definition defined under "Definition:" and I want you to reply with a list of bound function calls, binding the appropriate elements in the list to the arguments of the function. You should bind all possible arguments, and any arguments you can't bind, just bind with "None". Only emit each of the callsites line-by-line, nothing else. The function definitions are almost always calls to static methods, so make sure you emit the correct static method dispatch: SomeClass.static_method("arg1", "arg2" ...)

You can also use past messages (if any) as helpful context to figure out what to bind and how if the list doesn't contain sufficient information.
