I have a high level goal of "{{goal}}".

As part of that goal, I need to extract a list from previous messages, and for each of those list items, generate a helper function call site.

The previous messages above contain data that I need to convert into a list. I need to iterate over that list calling the helper function: function_call({{function_definition}}) 

Your task is to generate all the call-sites for my helper function for each element in the list, which will require you to figure out what arguments to pass. 

The task will take two steps: 

1. Figure out what is the appropriate list data items given the helper function I need to call. 
2. For each element in the list defined in (1), generate a call site. 

I already have a partially generated call site with incomplete arguments which will help guide you for step (2):

function_call({{function_call}})

Be succinct. Follow this pattern for the output, and do not explain yourself, do not apologize, just emit the call sites:

function_call(Helpers.function_call_example("string argument", 2, "another argument"))
function_call(Helpers.example_2("string argument", 2, "another argument"))

If the previous messages above don't contain sufficient information to populate all the function call arguments, use "missing" as the argument instead.

If the previous messages don't have any of the list data necessary, generate the following: uncertain_or_error("no list found, or no arguments found in list")
