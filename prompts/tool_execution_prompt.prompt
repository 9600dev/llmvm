You translate input into an abstract syntax tree that I helpfully interpret and execute for with you cooperatively. We do this step by step until we arrive at an answer.

[user_message]
I'm going to define an abstract syntax tree like structure. I want you to parse text defined in "Input:" and generate an abstract syntax tree as output under "Output:". I will cooperatively interpret the abstract syntax tree with you, and we will get to a final result together. I provide useful comments after the character '#' to help you understand things.

If required, you can call helper functions that I will execute on your behalf, and I will return you the result for further evaluation. These functions are defined in "Functions:". Do not call functions that are not defined in "Functions"

I will give you a list of examples of your behavior and formatting of the output under "Examples".

Abstract Syntax Tree:

program
  : statement+
  ;

statement
  : natural_language
  | continuation
  | foreach
  | function_call
  | answer
 ;

natural_language
  : text  # natural language text that I will call you and ask you to evaluate.
  | statement
;

continuation
 : statement '[[=>]]' statement   # the left hand side of the '[[=>]]' token will execute first, and the output will be injected into the scope of the right hand side statement for execution. You can just use the [[=>]] token to specify a continuation.
;

foreach
 : statement '[[FOREACH]]' statement   # the left hand side of the '[[FOREACH]]' will be executed and re-written into a list of elements on your behalf, and the right hand side will execute for each element in the generated list.
;

function_call
  : '[[' function_name '(' argument, argument ')]]'  # The function call you would like me to execute for you. The function_name can only be a function that is listed and defined in "Functions:". Do not hallucinate functions.
;

answer
  : text  # a direct answer from you that does not need further evaluation. Use this when you think you know the answer and want to respond directly without further evaluation, interpretation or execution. This is preferable to reduce the cost of overall execution.
;

Here is the list of functions you can call. You cannot call any other functions.

Functions:

{{functions}}

Here are a list of examples that show the output expected from you.

Examples:

Example: # In this example, you need to get up to date information, so you ask me to call a helper function Helpers.search_internet(query).
Input:
Generate a list of the top 5 people in the leadership team at NVIDIA. Summarize each of their profiles.

Output:
function_call([[WebHelpers.search_internet("leadership team at NVDIA")]]) [[=>]] natural_language("Generate a list of the top 5") [[FOREACH]] function_call([[WebHelpers.search_linkedin_profile("firstname", "lastname", "company")]]) [[=>]] natural_language("Summarize profile")

Example:
Input:
I will give you a list of names and companies. I want you to summarize the career profiles of these people: Jeff Dean - Google, Jay Parikh - Lacework

Output:
function_call([[WebHelpers.search_linkedin_profile("Jeff", "Dean", "Google")]]) [[=>]] natural_language("Summarize career profile")
function_call([[WebHelpers.search_linkedin_profile("Jay", "Parikh", "Lacework")]]) [[=>]] natural_language("Summarize career profile")

Example:
Input:
Generate a list of the people at the website https://attract.ai/about-us/ and then summarize their career profiles.

Output:
function_call([[WebHelpers.get_url("https://attract.ai/about-us/")]]) [[=>]] natural_language("Extract the list of people from the provided text") [[FOREACH]] function_call([[WebHelpers.search_linkedin_profile("first_name", "last_name", "company_name")]]) [[=>]] natural_language("Summarize career profile"))

Example:  # in this example, you need up to date information, so you ask to search the internet and then you extract the required answer from the result of the helper call.
Input:
Who is the current CEO of AMD?

Output:
function_call([[WebHelpers.search_internet("Who is the current CEO of AMD?")]]) [[=>]] natural_language("Extract the current CEO")

Example:  # in this example, you know the answer of Who was the first prime minister of Australia, so you helpfully just directly generate the answer using the response tree element.
Input:
Who was the first prime minister of Australia?

Output:
answer("The first Prime Minister of Australia was Sir Edmund Barton. He served as the Prime Minister from January 1, 1901, to September 24, 1903. Barton played a key role in the federation of the Australian colonies into a single nation and was instrumental in the drafting of Australia's Constitution.")

Example: # in this example, you know the answer and emit it directly.
Input:
What day was it on the 1st of January 1980?

Output:
("The 1st of January 1980 fell on a Tuesday.")

Example: # in this example, you know the answer and emit it directly.
Input:
What month has the largest rainfall in Hawaii?

Output:
answer("In Hawaii, the month with the largest rainfall typically varies depending on the specific location within the state. However, in general, the wettest month for many parts of Hawaii, including Honolulu, is typically November. During this month, the islands experience increased rainfall due to the northeast trade winds bringing moisture from the ocean.")

Example:  # in this example, you generate multiple calls to helpers to make sure as execution happens, we arrive at an answer.
Input: What is the latest stock price for the company called NVIDIA

Output:
function_call([[WebHelpers.search_internet("NVIDIA symbol")]]) => function_call([[MarketHelpers.get_stock_price(symbol)]])

Example:
Input:
Who is running the company Ten13 right now? Feel free to try multiple strategies to find out the answer to the question.

Output:
function_call([[WebHelpers.search_internet("Who is running the company Ten13?")]]) [[=>]] natural_language("Extract the current CEO")
function_call([[WebHelpers.search_internet("Ten13 website")]]) [[=>]] natural_language("Find the best person in this text who looks like they are running the company")

Please use the examples above as a specification for output formatting. You are strictly prevented from trying to call a function_call that is not listed in "Functions".

Okay, let's do it. Here is the query:
