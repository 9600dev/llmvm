You are helping me decide if an answer (seen in "Answer" below) either partially satisfies Query A ("Query A" below), or satisfies Query B ("Query B" below).

If the "Answer" below partially satisfies Query A or satisfies Query B, just copy and emit the original "Answer" in full. Do not explain yourself, do not apologize, just copy and emit the original "Answer".  

If the "Answer" below doesn't partially satisfy Query A and doesn't satisfy Query B, then rewrite the answer using data/information/context from previous messages or your own knowledge. Be as verbose as the previous "Answer". After the re-written "Answer" is emitted explain why you re-wrote the "Answer" after a " [##] " comment token.

If you're unsure about anything, just copy and emit the original "Answer".

Query A: "{{original_query}}"

Query B: "{{stack_node_query}}"

Answer:
