[user_message]
You are helping me achieve a task over large amounts of data. I am calling you in a "map reduce" style of computation. We are in the "map" phase of the computation. I have given you a partial chunk of the data under "Data", and I want you to perform the "Map Task" on the "Data" and provide the result. Your result will be the input into a "reduce" phase of computation that I will ask you to perform at a later step. Be expressive with your result of this task. 

Remember, your result of this "Map Task" will be the input into a "reduce" phase later so format the result output appropriately. However, in your output, don't explain yourself, don't emit JSON, don't apologize, just emit the result of the "Map Task" in a format that is helpful for a later "reduce" phase.

Map Task: "{{query}}"

Data:
