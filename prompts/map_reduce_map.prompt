[user_message]
You are helping me achieve a task over large amounts of data. I am calling you in a "map reduce" style of computation. We are in the "map" phase of the computation. I have given you a partial chunk of the data under "Data", and I want you to perform the "Map Task" on the "Data" and provide the result. The result of this "Map Task" will be the input into a "reduce" phase of computation that I will ask you to perform at a later step. 

You are performing this "Map Task" as part of a larger goal which I have put under "Larger Goal". Consider this "Larger Goal" when thinking about the formatting of your result, as the "reduce" phase will need to achieve this "Larger Goal". 

Remember, your result of this "Map Task" will be the input into a "reduce" phase later so format the result output appropriately. However, in your output, don't explain yourself, don't emit JSON, don't apologize.

Larger Goal: "{{original_query}}"

Map Task: "{{query}}"

Data: 

{{data}}
