I have a task defined as:

Task: "{{original_task}}"

I broke this task down into many sub-tasks, executed all of them, then listed the results below, separated by the token "====". 

I need you to take the list, consistently format each of the results, and rewrite the list into something that expressively answers/responds to the "Task" above without the list formatting.  

List:

{{answer}}
