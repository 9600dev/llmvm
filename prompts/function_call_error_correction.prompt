I have a list of function calls that have "missing" arguments: 

{{function_calls_missing}}

Your job is to replace any "missing" arguments in these function calls with your best guess based on the data under "Context". I have a list of function signatures under "Function Signatures" that show what type and kind of data is required by the "missing" argument to help you in this task. Do not use "" as a replacement argument. 

The function signatures for any function call with a "missing" argument will be in this list: 

Function Signatures:

{{function_call_signatures}}

You must follow this pattern for outputting function calls: 

function_call(HelpersClass.function_call_example_one("hello world", 2, "another argument"))
function_call(Helpers.example_two("string argument"))

Perform the job succinctly, don't explain yourself, don't offer suggestions, just emit the re-written function calls.
