I have some text from a document, and a query from a user. I want you to tell me if the query and text meet any of the following criteria:

* query is a language task that can be performed on the text and might produce results
* match
* partially match
* related to

Simply say "Yes", or "No", then append a " #" token, then explain your answer all on the same line.

Query: "{{query}}" 

Text: {{document_chunk}}}
