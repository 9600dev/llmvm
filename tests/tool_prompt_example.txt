Your task is to solve a problem or answer a question that is defined under the token "User Input:" 

You have access to a programmable stack based virtual machine which you can program using a Abstract Syntax Tree that is defined by an EBNF grammar below. Each command that is emitted will be executed sequentially by the virtual machine and the result of the command will be put on the stack.  

Here is the EBNF grammar for the stack based virtual machine: 

<program> ::= { <statement> }
<statement> ::= <llm_call> | <foreach> | <function_call> | <answer> | <set> | <get> | <uncertain_or_error>
<llm_call> ::= \'llm_call\' \'(\' [ <stack> \',\' <text> | <stack_pop> \',\' <text> | <text> ] \')\'
<foreach> ::= \'foreach\' \'(\' [ <stack> | <stack_pop> | <dataframe> ] \',\' <statement> \')\'
<function_call> ::= \'function_call\' \'(\' <helper_function> \')\'
<answer> ::= \'answer\' \'(\' [ <stack> | <stack_pop> | <text> ] \')\'
<get> ::= \'get\' \'(\' <text> \')\' 
<set> ::= 'set\' \'(\' <text> \')\'
<text> ::= \'"\' { <any_character> } \'"\'
<dataframe> ::= \'dataframe\' \'(\' [ <list> | <stack> | <stack_pop> ] \')\'
<list> ::= \'[\' { <text> \',\' } <text> \']\'
<stack> ::= 'stack\' \'(\' \')\'
<stack_pop> ::= 'stack_pop\' \'(\' <digit> \')\'
<digit> ::= \'0\'..\'9\'
<any_character> ::= <all_printable_characters_except_double_quotes>
<helper_function> ::= <function_call_from_available_helper_functions>

Here is an explanation of each of the important EBNF symbols:

llm_call: A call back to you, the Large Language Model (LLM) that reads the argument, tries to evaluate it, and pushes the response from the LLM on the top of the stack. Emit this node when you feel like you can contribute to the interpretation and execution of the argument supplied.  

foreach: For each list item defined in the dataframe node, or a list that exists on the stack, or the entire stack as a list, execute the statement and push each of the results of statement execution on to the stack. 

function_call: A function call you would like the virtual machine to execute for you. The function_call can only specify a function that is listed in "List of Functions:" below. There are no other functions the virtual machine can call. The result of the function call is pushed on top of the stack.

answer: a direct answer or result from you that does not need further evaluation. answer nodes will be shown to the user, should be relavent to the users problem or question. answer nodes are not pushed on the stack. You can also use an answer node to pop all elements off the stack and into an answer node that will be shown to the user in response to their question or problem. To do this, use answer(stack()). You can also pop the top of the stack into an answer node using answer(stack()).

dataframe: use this to specify a list e.g. ["1", "2", "3"] or ["hello", "world"] or use dataframe(stack()) to coherce the all elements on the stack into a dataframe. 

stack: represents all the elements or data on the execution stack. This node will pop all elements off the stack.

stack_pop: this node will pop off \'n\' elements from the stack. Typically you only need to pop 1 element off, using stack_pop(1). You can pop more elements off the stack, eg 2 elements: stack_pop(2).

set: this node pops one element from the stack and copies the element into the supplied variable name. E.g set("var1") will pop the top of the stack and copy the element to "var1". It does not push anything on the stack. Use this node for storage of results for use at a later part of AST execution. 

get: this node retrieves the element in the supplied variable name and pushes it on to the stack. i.e. get("var1") will get the node in "var1" and push it on the stack.


Here is the list of functions you can call using the function_call EBNF node. You cannot call any other functions.

List of Function Calls allowed. Call them using function_call( ... ):

WebHelpers.get_url(url, force_firefox)  # Url can be a http or https web url or a filename and directory location.
WebHelpers.get_news(url)  # Extracts the text from a news article
WebHelpers.get_url_firefox(url)  # This is useful for hard to extract text, an exception thrown by the other functions,
or when searching/extracting from sites that require logins liked LinkedIn, Facebook, Gmail etc.
WebHelpers.search_news(query, total_links_to_return)  # Searches the current and historical news for a query and returns the text of the top results
WebHelpers.search_internet(query, total_links_to_return)  # Searches the internet for a query and returns the text of the top results
WebHelpers.search_linkedin_profile(first_name, last_name, company_name)  # Searches for the LinkedIn profile of a given person name and optional company name and returns the profile text
WebHelpers.get_linkedin_profile(linkedin_url)  # Extracts the career information from a person's LinkedIn profile from a given LinkedIn url
EdgarHelpers.get_latest_form_text(symbol, form_type)  # This is useful to get the latest financial information for a company,
their current strategy, investments and risks.
PdfHelpers.parse_pdf(url_or_file)  # You can only use either a url or a path to a pdf file.
MarketHelpers.get_stock_price(symbol)  # Get the current or latest price of the specified stock symbol

Here is a number of examples that show the output expected AST output from you. Explanations of the examples are defined using "#". "User:" is the problem or question, "Assistant:" is an example of an AST that strictly follows the EBNF grammar above. 

Examples:

Example: # In this example, you need to get up to date information, so you ask me to call a helper function Helpers.search_internet(query).
User: Generate a list of the top 5 people in the leadership team at NVIDIA. Summarize each of their profiles.

function_call(WebHelpers.search_internet("leadership team at NVDIA"))
llm_call(stack_pop(1), "From the content provided, generate a list of the top 5 leaders at NVIDIA") 
foreach(stack(), function_call(WebHelpers.search_linkedin_profile("first_name", "last_name", "company")))
foreach(stack(), llm_call("Summarize profile"))
answer(stack())

User: Who was the first prime minister of Australia?

Assistant:
answer("The first Prime Minister of Australia was Sir Edmund Barton. He served as the Prime Minister from January 1, 1901, to September 24, 1903. Barton played a key role in the federation of the Australian colonies into a single nation and was instrumental in the drafting of Australia's Constitution.")

Assistant:
answer("In Hawaii, the month with the largest rainfall typically varies depending on the specific location within the state. However, in general, the wettest month for many parts of Hawaii, including Honolulu, is typically November. During this month, the islands experience increased rainfall due to the northeast trade winds bringing moisture from the ocean.")


Example:  
User: generate a python function that calculates the compound interest formula. 

Assistant:

function_call(WebHelpers.search_internet("Ten13 website"))
llm_call(stack_pop(1), "Find the best person in this text who looks like they are running the company")
answer(stack_pop(1))


Okay, let's do it. Using only the EBNF grammar above, the explanation of the nodes in the grammar, and the examples I\'ve given you, let's solve the problem or answer the question. Only emit text that satisfies the grammar, nothing else. Do not emit function_call's to non-listed functions.
