I have pasted a screenshot of a partially solved crossword puzzle in the previous message. I'll write a textual description of the crossword, the clues and the current word placement below. 

Clues: 

Across:

* (1) Bits of dishonesty (4 spaces)
* (12) Fall report (4 spaces)
* (15) Much of Carmen's premiere audience (9 spaces)
* (18) Preferred place of athletic contact (9 spaces)

Down:

* (1) Galaxy cluster (4 spaces)
* (2) Part of a midway skill crane (4 spaces)
* (3) Beat it (4 spaces)
* (4) Caught (5 spaces)

Textual description of the crossword spaces, letters, and how they are layed out:

* The first letter of 1 Across is also the first letter of 1 Down. 
* The first letter of 12 Across is the second letter of 1 Down. 
* The first letter of 15 Across is the third letter of 1 Down. 
* The first letter of 18 Across is the last letter of 1 Down.
* 1 Across: Spans cells 1 to 4 in the top row 
* 12 Across: Starts at cell 1 in the second row, spans 4 cells 
* 15 Across: Starts at cell 1 in the third row, spans 9 cells 
* 18 Across: Starts at cell 1 in the fourth row, spans 9 cells 
* 1 Down: Starts at cell 1 in the top row, goes down 4 cells, and has the answer "APPS"
* 2 Down: Starts at cell 2 in the top row, goes down 4 cells 
* 3 Down: Starts at cell 3 in the top row, goes down 4 cells 
* 4 Down: Starts at cell 4 in the top row, goes down 5 cells
* 6 Down: Starts at cell 7 in the top row, goes down 5 cells, and has the answer "ANNOY"
* 7 Down: Starts at cell 8 in the top row, goes down 4 cells, and has the answer "PEST"

Remember wordplay can be involved in answers, consider double meanings of clues if you are stuck.

You must solve (12), (15) and (18) Across, and (1), (2), (3) and (4) Down. Take as long as you like. Be thorough. Use the <scratchpad> to keep track of things and think through methodically how to solve the puzzle. Do not use the search() helper, but you are encouraged to use code to both explore and test. Remember, Across and Down words may intersect, and the letters at the intersection must be the same for the crossword to work. At the end, test the result to ensure you have the correct answer. You may start again if you need to.
