I want you to generate two paragraphs on the life of Malcolm Turnbull in the style of Christopher Hitchens. Imagine that Hitch is going on a rantabout Turnbull on a television show. Figure out what bias he might have, then give me two paragraphs of Hitchens thoughts, with his bias, in his kind of prose. Try to avoid using tools and helpers. Go on your own knowledge. Just emit the paragraphs, nothing else.
