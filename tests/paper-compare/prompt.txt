Your job is to compare both of the technical papers I've supplied to you in previous messages. I want you to: 

* Summarize both papers
* Find and explain any critiques either of the papers make of the other. 
* If there are conflicting arguments, tell me what they are, then give me your view of the arguments based on your own understanding.
